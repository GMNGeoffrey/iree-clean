## Operation definition

### `check.expect_all_true` (IREE::Check::ExpectAllTrueOp)

Checks that the operand contains only values that are true

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `check.expect_all_true` `(` $operand `)` attr-dict `:` type($operand)
```


Verifies that the operand contains true values, which are represented by any
non-zero integer.

Issues a non-fatal failure if the verification fails.

#### Operands:

| Operand | Description |
| :-----: | ----------- |
`operand` | buffer_view or tensor of signless integer values

### `check.expect_almost_eq` (IREE::Check::ExpectAlmostEqOp)

Checks that the operands are almost equal

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `check.expect_almost_eq` `(` $lhs `,` $rhs `)` attr-dict `:` type($lhs)
```


Verifies that the buffer view or tensor operands with float elements are
almost equal to within an implementation-defined "reasonable" tolerance.

Issues a non-fatal failure if the verification fails.

#### Operands:

| Operand | Description |
| :-----: | ----------- |
`lhs` | buffer_view or tensor of floating-point values
`rhs` | buffer_view or tensor of floating-point values

### `check.expect_eq` (IREE::Check::ExpectEqOp)

Checks that the tensor or buffer view operands are equal

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `check.expect_eq` `(` $lhs `,` $rhs `)` attr-dict `:` type($lhs)
```


Verifies that the operands are exactly equal.

Issues a non-fatal failure if the verification fails.

#### Operands:

| Operand | Description |
| :-----: | ----------- |
`lhs` | buffer_view or tensor of any type values
`rhs` | buffer_view or tensor of any type values

### `check.expect_false` (IREE::Check::ExpectFalseOp)

Checks that the operand is false

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `check.expect_false` `(` $operand `)` attr-dict `:` type($operand)
```


Verifies that the operand contains a false value, which is represented by
zero.

Issues a non-fatal failure if the verification fails.

#### Operands:

| Operand | Description |
| :-----: | ----------- |
`operand` | signless integer

### `check.expect_true` (IREE::Check::ExpectTrueOp)

Checks that the operand is true

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `check.expect_true` `(` $operand `)` attr-dict `:` type($operand)
```


Verifies that the operand contains a true value, which is represented by
any non-zero integer.

Issues a non-fatal failure if the verification fails.

#### Operands:

| Operand | Description |
| :-----: | ----------- |
`operand` | signless integer
